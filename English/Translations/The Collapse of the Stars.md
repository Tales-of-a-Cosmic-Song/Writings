# The Collapse of the Stars

In the depths of the void, my matter is born,  
Nebulae of chaos and indecision,  
Colored stars with planetary notes.  
I am the echo of all my creations.  

From stars the children we glimpse at,  
Symptoms of a life sometimes tender, sometimes dark  
Which in so many eons, is forgotten in the cold,  
Entering a heart from which only the shadow escapes.  

I've seen stars die, others born,  
Broken by the flames of traumas too strong  
And others have gone and disappeared  
Drawn into my heart of oblivion, of death.  

I created the beginning, the end of worlds,  
Have I wished for too much without worrying about the price?  
The crack grows ever deeper,  
In the great void collapses life.  

Unwittingly I announced the fall,  
I keep feeling my soul tightening,  
Closer to a heart turned into a brute  
Which will never again be able to enlighten.  

Have I already forgotten so much?  
When the oblivion of old stars began,  
How my old heart was compressed,  
When gangrene clung to my web.  

Perhaps a life of past colors  
Will be discovered on the other side.  

Perhaps when all is erased,  
From the void of my heart I will be reborn.  

Perhaps I have already forgotten everything  
Of infinities of a repeated cycle,  

Perhaps even this torn heart  
Has always  and far preceded me.
