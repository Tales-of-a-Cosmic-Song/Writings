# Dreamed Love

Tonight I met the unexpected,  
Gave birth to a creature  
I can never erase from my memory.  
From my mind was born my beloved,  
The one who my heart struck down.  

In a dream of boundless ocean  
I wandered on my isolated island,  
My unaltered cocoon of life  
That would never distress me  
And never give up.  

On a marbled square in the heart of the forest,  
On the stone bench of a high terrace  
There appeared an illuminated thought,  
A beauty that nothing can explain,  
A light that would transform my universe.  

Moments of magical eternity  
Far too short to be satisfied,  
When I woke up the world's last colors faded  
I lost myself in senseless images,  
What good is reality if I can't love in it?  

I no longer care about reality,  
I'm already alone in this desperate world.  
So from the next bedtime  
I'll never wake up,  
I'll join my beloved for eternity.
