# Dreaming Forest

Sheltered by a mountain of stars,  
Enlightened by songs of the night,  
The peaceful forest sleeps and dreams.  

Dreams of a great winged sun,  
Dreams of an arboreal music,  
Dreams of a colorful mat.  

Advances the bewitchment of the woods,  
To calm the night, raise the day  
And build on this completed dream.  

Sees a sun rise,  
Sees all the trees sing,  
Sees the earth get colored.  

From the tops of its gigantic brushes,  
The forest paints its ceiling green,  
Dotted with blue and gold stars.  

And every night  

Dreams of a great winged sun,  
Dreams of an arboreal music,  
Dreams of a colorful mat.  

For every day to  

See a sun rise,  
See all the trees sing,  
See the earth get colored.
