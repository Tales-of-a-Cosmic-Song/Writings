# Towers of History

Great towers near each [yeki](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yeki.md) storing the archives of the [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md)' actions.  
Each individual year of archive is stored in a [rëgi](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/rëgi.md), each tower holding hundreds of thousands of them.  
There are local towers near each yeki but also a set of global towers near [Shôkrodo](../Characters/Shôkrodo.md).
