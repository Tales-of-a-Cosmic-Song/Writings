# Punctuation

All punctuation is replaced by "punctuation words" at the end of phrases.  
They are said as words but written as specific punctuation characters in the [Kivümi script](Script.md)  
- "." is "[ey](./Kivümi%20Dictionary/ey.md)"  
- "!" is "[ok](./Kivümi%20Dictionary/ok.md)"  
- "?" is "[or](./Kivümi%20Dictionary/or.md)"
