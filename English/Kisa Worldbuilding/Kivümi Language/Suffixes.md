# Suffixes

## 1. From Nouns to Verbs and Adjectives

Almost all verbs and adjectives are nouns with a suffix.  
All verbs have the -vir suffix.  
All adjectives have the -din suffix.  

Nouns of agency, describing an agent or actor associated with the action, can be formed by adding the -i suffix to any verb.  
Example :  
- Base noun :  
  love = kye  
- Verb :  
  to love = kyevir  
- Noun of agency :  
  lover = kyeviri  

Most basic concept nouns are words of only one syllable ending with a vowel.  
More complex ones are usually combinations of multiple simple concept nouns.  

Can make a past participle noun from a verb by changing the -vir suffix with -vag.  

## 2. Antonyms, Superlative, Definiteness and Plural

We can form antonyms from nouns and adjectives by adding the suffix -mük, if used on adjectives it is always used before the -din suffix.  
Adjectives and nouns can be complemented with a superlative degree by adding the suffix -üb.  

Definiteness is marked by the use of a suffix on definite nouns only, never on indefinite ones. The suffix used is -sol.  

Plural is marked by the use of the -th suffix on nouns ending in vowels and -ath suffix on nouns ending in consonants, it is always placed last in the suffix order.  

## 3. Numbers

All numbers have the -lod suffix.  
All ordinal numerals are numbers with the -ilun suffix.  

***Using RFC 4648 Base32 alphabet***

BA to 7A use the suffix -ad :  
- BA is ilodad  
  - 32 in decimal  
- CA is elodad  
  - 64 in decimal  
...  
- 7A is ëyilodad  
  - 992 in decimal

BAA to 7AA use the suffix -or :  
- BAA is ilodor  
  - 1024 in decimal  
- CAA is elodor  
  - 2048 in decimal  
...  
- 7AA is ëyilodor  
  - 31744 in decimal  

BAAA to 7AAA use the suffix -ig :  
- BAAA is ilodig  
  - 32768 in decimal  
- CAAA is elodig  
  - 65536 in decimal  
...  
- 7AAA is ëyilodig  
  - 1015808 in decimal  

It then combines the previous suffixes.  
BAAAA to 7AAAA use the suffix -igad.  
BAAAAA to 7AAAAA use the suffix -igor.  
BAAAAAA to 7AAAAAA use the suffix -igig.  
BAAAAAAA to 7AAAAAAA use the suffix -igigad.  
...  
Et cetera.
