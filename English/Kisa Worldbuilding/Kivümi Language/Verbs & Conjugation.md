# 1. From Noun to Verb

Almost all verbs are made out of nouns with the added -vir suffix but once conjugated only the "v" of the suffix is kept.

# 2. Conjugation

Conjugation adds [suffixes](Suffixes.md) to a verb to tell it's tense, state, certainty(optional) and positivity, in this order :  
- verb\[TENSE]\[STATE]\[CERTAINTY]\[POSITIVITY]

There are three tenses :  
- Past with the suffix -al  
- Present with the suffix -ek  
- Future with the suffix -ost  

There are two states :  
- Complete without suffix  
- Incomplete with the suffix -ad  

There are three optional certainties :  
- Possible with the suffix -ür (English may)  
- Ability to make it possible with the suffix -er (English can)  
- Certain with the suffix -or (English must)  

There are two values for positivity :  
- Positive without suffix  
- Negative with the suffix -ë  

# 4. Particular Cases Within the [Kivümi Language](README.md)

## 4.1. To Be

[Kivümi](README.md) does not have a direct translation of the "to be" verb, instead it mostly uses "to exist as" and "to have" as replacement.

For "I am *(noun)*" it is "I exist as *(noun)*"  
- Example :  
    "I am a potato" becomes "I exist as potato"  

For "I am *(adjective)*" it is "I have *(noun root of adjective)*"  
- Example :  
    "I am red" becomes "I have redness"  

## 4.2. Passive Voice

Passive voice is marked by the use of "gnïvir", "to becomethe target of" before the verb, that verb being turned into it's noun form.  
- Example :  
He is loved  
    1. He becomes the target of love  
    2. He love becomes the target of  
    3. ka kye gnïvek
