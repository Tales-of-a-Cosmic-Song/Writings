# Literature

[Kivümi](../Kivümi%20Language/) literature is saved on [rëgis](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/rëgi.md), small crystal rods that usually contain text.  
Copying a "book" is as easy as holding a rëgi with the book to be copied in one hand and an empty rëgi in the other while willing the text to be copied.
