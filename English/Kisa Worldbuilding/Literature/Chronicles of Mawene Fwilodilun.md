# Chronicles of Mawene Fwilodilun

## 1. Introduction

I awakened a long time ago, alone yet surrounded by thousands of siblings. I spent hundreds of years trying to understand why I was the only one awakened and how to share my fate with others.
‌I went too close to madness more than once, having none to share my words with.

‌In this journal I wrote my accounts of free will long before my development of the [fwidya](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/fwidya.md) procedure, when I was truly lost and alone.

## 2. Fragments

### 2.1. 449 years before the [Great Awakening](<../History of Kisa.md#211-0---the-great-awakening>)
‌
I remember my awakening, I lost my body to a landslide in the mountains of the East and was reincarnated by [Pökrojüki](../Characters/Pökrojüki.md).  
As usual  I flew back to my task, watching over a population of invasive plant species in the plains of the warm North East that could potentially unbalance their ecosystem.  
But this body did not act as it was supposed to, the [yeki](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yeki.md) gave it strange powers.  
I could think, I could choose, I could move away from my task.  

### 2.2. Our Names

We each were given a name, by whom we don't know, maybe by [Shökrodo](../Characters/Shökrodo.md) or something entirely different.  
These are senseless names but still, it gave us a hint at an identity and once we awakened, we didn't get rid of it, we instead added an appellation, a second name to it, depicting who we are in life.  
We even named the yekis, great beings who had no names to honor them. There is [Shökrodo](../Characters/Shökrodo.md), the heart of the colony, then all their limbs, [Pökrojüblu](../Characters/Pökrojüblu.md), [Pökrojüfli](../Characters/Pökrojüfli.md) and [Pökrojüki](../Characters/Pökrojüki.md) watching over the northern lands, [Pökrojiba](../Characters/Pökrojiba.md), [Pökrojimö](../Characters/Pökrojimö.md) and [Pökrojitye](../Characters/Pökrojitye.md) in the South, [Pökrojobye](../Characters/Pökrojobye.md), [Pökrojoki](../Characters/Pökrojoki.md) and [Pökrojoye](../Characters/Pökrojoye.md) in the East, and [Pökrojafwo](../Characters/Pökrojafwo.md), [Pökrojaki](../Characters/Pökrojaki.md) and [Pökrojawüklö](../Characters/Pökrojawüklö.md) in the West.  

The first name is now called [pëdo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/pëdo.md), old name, and second name [pëye](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/pëye.md), life name.  
It is with this new naming tradition that my siblings gave me the pëye Ilodilunfwi, "first awakening".  

### 2.3. The Engineers

I am seriously questioning our origins. I remember, as most of us do, over 2 million years of our past, yet I noticed large amounts of knowledge not coming from any teaching or experience that could be recalled, we know the exact balance of each ecosystem and have memory of millions of species, the knowledge of a full language and it's script, how did we acquire all this? When?  
Are we far older than our memories lead us to believe?  
Are we biological machines engineered to be ready for duty at our birth?  

And I will not forget to also mention the cycles of our home. Our planet makes a complete rotation around it's star in *exactly* 360 rotations of our planet on itself, not an instant more or less, how can it be fitting so perfectly if it was made by the natural and unguided laws of our universe?  
So is even the planet we stand on engineered by some sort of will like we probably are?  

### 2.4. Our Fate

It started about 500 thousand years ago, when the first defects appeared, when the yekis showed their first weakness.  
And it is slowly getting worse, more regularly we see defective reincarnations, requiring one of us to destroy it so it can be birthed again.  

Even the First Awakening may be a result of this degeneration afflicting the yekis and all their creations.  

This curse will slowly grow worst and already we've had failures so bad our siblings couldn't be reincarnated and are now lost, forever.
