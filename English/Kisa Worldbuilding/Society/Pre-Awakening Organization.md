# Pre-Awakening Organization

Before they gained free will, the [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md) were organised around each [yeki](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yeki.md) and each held a [rëgi](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/rëgi.md) to keep track of their tasks.  
Each role could be achieved by multiple kivüs at a time, ensuring redundancy.  

- Each of the 12 regional yekis with a [Tower of History](./Towers%20of%20History.md) is organized around :
