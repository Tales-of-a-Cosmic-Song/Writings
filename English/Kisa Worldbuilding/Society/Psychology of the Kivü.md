# Psychology of the Kivüs

## 1. A Question

```
"How would you imagine the psychology of godlike creatures that just gained free will out of nowhere and do not have material needs?
I already consider that they are driven to discover and understand their past as well as finding a goal in life(before their free will they were doing specific tasks endlessly for millions of years but once they gained free will they can still return to their innate tasks as a way to relax), but what else?"
```

## 2. Rough Brainstorming

### 2.1. Some General Thoughts

The [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md) were psychologically stable during their first 2.5 million years, but once they gained free will they suddenly asked for purpose, questioned themselves and their history.  
It led to the development of spirituality, religion, but also depression and boredom(that could be partially diminished by doing the innate tasks they were programmed into doing before free will).  

The need for power also appeared with the existential questions.  

### 2.2. What Could Drive Them

- Free Will but still have the drive to achieve their innate tasks.
- Start to think about motives that go beyond their innate tasks.
- How curious are the kivü?
	- They do not :
		- Feel the need to explore space.
		- Feel the need to explore [Begï](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Begï.md) any further than [Kisa](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Kisa.md) itself.
		- Feel the need to own material objects.
		- Easily connect emotionally with their siblings.
	- They do :
		- Feel the need to discover and understand their past.
		- Feel the need to discover and understand their goal in life.
		- Feel the need to have social interactions.
		- Feel the need to create things that are unique.

## 3. An Archetype

### 3.1. Traits

From the previous explorations we can define a few traits that would commonly define the kivü species, but that can be deviated from on an individual basis.  

| They Are  | They Are Not  |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Curious   | Materialistic |
| Creative  | Empathetic    |
| Social    |               |
| Ambitious |               |
| Practical |               |
| Spiritual |               |
