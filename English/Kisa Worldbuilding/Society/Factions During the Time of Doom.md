# Factions During the [Time of Doom]

## 1. The last [kivü](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md)

[Hepïpü Shömükmyo](../Characters/Hepïpü%20Shömükmyo.md) is the last remaining kivü, impaled on a mountain East of [Kisa](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Kisa.md).  
They are slowly being drained of their energy.  

They try to telepathically communicate with the [deformed](#2-the-deformed) to give them purpose and a peaceful death, but none of the deformed factions trust Hepïpü Shömükmyo.  

## 2. The Deformed

The deformed are short lived and incompletely formed kivüs born during the Time of Doom.  
The slow draining of the impaled Hepïpü Shömükmyo caused the remains of the [yekis](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yeki.md) to birth the deformed, most of them too incomplete to move or do anything else than screaming and crying.  
As opposed to the kivüs, the deformed have no intrinsic goal and are condemned to wonder aimlessly through Kisa's wasteland until they die.  

Some of them managed to collaborate together and create small communities, the most important ones being the [City of the Fallen](../Notable%20Locations/City%20of%20the%20Fallen.md), the [City of the Forgotten](../Notable%20Locations/City%20of%20the%20Forgotten.md) and the [City of the Wanderers](../Notable%20Locations/City%20of%20the%20Wanderers.md).
