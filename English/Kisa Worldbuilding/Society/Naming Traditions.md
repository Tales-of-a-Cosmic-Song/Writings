# Naming Traditions

## 1. Kivü First Names

Called [pëdo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/pëdo.md), they don't have any meaning and are all random 3 syllables words, the [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md) already had these names on their first incarnation.  

## 2. Second Names

Called [pëye](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/pëye.md), they were given after the Great Awakening to all the [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md) but also to the [yekis](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yeki.md), they are related to the acts of their owner in life.  
They are built using a main noun followed by, usually, adjectives in their noun form.  

Examples :
- [Hepîpü Shômükmyo](../Characters/Hepïpü%20Shömükmyo.md)
	- [shô](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/shô.md)mük means "un-creator" or "destroyer".  
	- [myo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/myo.md) is the noun form of [myodin](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/myodin.md), meaning "great".  
- [Mawene Fwilodilun](../Characters/Mawene%20Fwilodilun.md)
	- [fwi](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/fwi.md) means "awakening".  
	- [ilod](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/ilod.md)ilun means "first".

These guidelines also roughly apply to most composed words.  

## 3. About the Yeki

The yekis have no first name as they weren't named before the Great Awakening, and the second name of all secondary yekis follows a specific method :  
- They all start by [pô](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/pö.md), meaning "branch".
- Followed by [kro](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kro.md), meaning "great".
- Then [ji](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/ji.md), meaning South, [jü](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/jü.md), meaning North, [jo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/jo.md), meaning East or [ja](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/ja.md), meaning West, depending on the yeki's location.
- And finally any adjective in it's noun form.
