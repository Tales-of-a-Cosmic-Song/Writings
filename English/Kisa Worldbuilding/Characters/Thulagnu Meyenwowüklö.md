<div align="right"><i>θulaɲu Mæjænwowyklɔ</i></div>

[Kivü](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md) scientist of the [Lost](<../Society/Religious Groups.md#122-the-lost>).  
Worked, with a certain Dizeho, on a method to change from a body into a relatively stable [yenwo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yenwo.md) state, allowing some survivability in areas lacking yenwo, like space.

Lost with his research when they were devoured by a Cavern of Flesh sent to stop them by the [Messengers of the Yekis](<../Society/Religious Groups.md#2-messengers-of-the-yekis>).  
The attack caused Thulagnu to get himself turned into an incomplete yenwo state, causing his death by leaking energy barely a few hours after the attack.
