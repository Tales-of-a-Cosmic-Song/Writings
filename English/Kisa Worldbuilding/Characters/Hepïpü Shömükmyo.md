Last of the [kivüs](../Natural%20Science/Unique%20Species/kivü.md) from [Kisa](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Kisa.md), impaled on the mountains of the island and source of the later world's [yenwo](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yenwo.md) volcanoes.  

## Hepïpü Shömükmyo's Gift

One day Hepïpü reincarnated with the ability to absorb yenwo, from the environment but also directly from other beings, like their kivü siblings.  
Some [Messengers of the Yeki](<../Society/Cults of the Engineers.md>) thought that this power was willingly given by the [yeki](../Natural%20Science/Unique%20Species/yeki.md) to Hepïpü in hopes it would help stop the wars ravaging Kisa.  
It backfired horribly as it couldn't be controlled and annihilated all life on Kisa, leaving only a few surviving kivüs exiled far to the North on an unknown continent.  
It is more likely that their gift came from being affected by the [Degeneration of the Yeki].  

Hepïpü truly wanted to help their siblings go towards peace and save their civilization and land, but even before the loss of control over the Gift, Hepïpü went to quite tyrannical lengths to force the peace.
