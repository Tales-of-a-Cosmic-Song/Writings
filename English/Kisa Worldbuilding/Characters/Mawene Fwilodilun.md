<div align="right"><i>mawænæ fwilodilun</i></div>

First of the Awakened [kivüs](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/kivü.md), spent hundreds of years in loneliness trying to awaken others.  
Wrote his [Chronicles of Mawene Fwilodilun|Chronicles](<../Literature/Chronicles of Mawene Fwilodilun.md>), detailing their life and thoughts after their early awakening.  

## 1. The First Awakening

Mawene awakened due to the [Degeneration of the Yeki].  
They didn't notice they were different until some time had passed since their Awakening, their only defect being their free will.  

## 2. Mawene's Evolution Post Awakening

1. First 10 years or so Mawene did not notice much difference, they kept at their innate task but with a little bit of inner noise.  
2. Going into 100 years, this inner noise became organized thoughts and these thoughts guided Mawene into, once, deviating from their innate tasks.
3. This deviation is like a revelation and Mawene put their task behind to explore [Kisa](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Kisa.md).  
4. Only 10 years later Mawene started to feel the weight of loneliness.
