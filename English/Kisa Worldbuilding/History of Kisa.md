Very slowly went worse and worse.  

Some failures are more obvious than others and the Awakening of [Mawene Fwilodilun](./Characters/Mawene%20Fwilodilun.md) wasn't obvious at all, the only defect being them having free will.

The kivüs that survived after their exile slowly change, mutating and giving birth to a new form of life.  

Meanwhile on Kisa, the remains of the yekis regain some powers and begin birthing creatures again, but these attempts at creating kivüs once more are a failure and make the [deformed](<./Society/Factions During the Time of Doom.md#2-the-deformed>), abominations who will live short lifes of pain and loneliness.
