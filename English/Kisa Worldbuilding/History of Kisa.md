Most usually the victims of these failed births had genetic or birth defects and in some very rare cases some very unique advantages.  
Very slowly went worse and worse.  

Some failures are more obvious than others and the Awakening of [Mawene Fwilodilun](./Characters/Mawene%20Fwilodilun.md) wasn't obvious at all, the only defect being them having free will.

## 3. Time of Doom

The 30 000 years that follow the end of the Time of the Kivüs, before a new civilization could emerge on an other continent, far to the North.  

The planet trembles from Hepïpü Shömükmyo's sacrifice, causing massive earthquakes that slowly reshape the land and give birth to 3 yenwo volcanoes on the Northern continent.  
The kivüs that survived after their exile slowly change, mutating and giving birth to a new form of life.  

Meanwhile on Kisa, the remains of the yekis regain some powers and begin birthing creatures again, but these attempts at creating kivüs again is a failure as what comes out are the [deformed](<./Society/Factions During the Time of Doom.md#2-the-deformed>), abominations who will live short lives of pain and loneliness.
