# Caverns of Flesh

Gigantic worms created by the [Messengers of the Yekis](<../../Society/Religious Groups.md#2-messengers-of-the-yekis>) to fight other religious entities.  
They live underground and can very rarely be seen in the temperate plains and the toundra.  

They are carnivorous but do not require to eat often. They hunt by opening the ground under large groups of animals, causing them to fall into the worm's large mouth.  

Their digestive system is what give them their name, trapping their prey in large fleshy caverns slowly decomposing them.  
Eaten creatures do not always die directly after being consumed and can wonder the caverns aimlessly for days before expiring.  
Their digestive system also blocks all [yenwo](../../Kiv端mi%20Language/Kiv端mi%20Dictionary/yenwo.md) from entering as well as disabling most of the kiv端s powers and making the trapped kiv端s unable to be resurrected by the yekis, making them incredible weapons.
