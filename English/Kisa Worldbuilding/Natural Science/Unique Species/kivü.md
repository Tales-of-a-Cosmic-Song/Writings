They speak the [Kivümi](../../Kivümi%20Language/) language.  
They are born from the [yekis](yeki.md) and are asexual.  

Measuring between 2m and 2.5m tall, they look like larger humans with slightly blueish skin and mostly atrophied muscles due to the lack of physical exercise.  
Usually moving by flying or floating, barely ever using their legs.  

They can detect variations in the vital energy called [yenwo](../../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/yenwo.md), otherwise their senses are quite similar to humans.  
They do not usually need to eat, drink or breath, as long as this energy is heavily available in the area.  
Where it is lacking yenwo they do need food, water and air, in these contitions their bodies will slowly degrade until they die or return to an energy filled area.

On most of Kisa there is more than enough vital energy to sustain massive powers, like telepathic communication with any visible target, telekinesis and the ability to create almost anything they can think of by thought.
