The slow draining of the impaled [Hepîpü Shômükmyo](../../Characters/Hepîpü%20Shômükmyo.md) caused the remains of the [yekis](./yeki.md) to birth the deformed, most of them too incomplete to move or do anything else than screaming and crying.  
As opposed to the [kivüs](./kivü.md), the deformed have no intrinsic goal and are condemned to wonder aimlessly through Kisa's wasteland until they die.  

Some of them managed to collaborate together and create communities.  
The most important ones being the [Nevags](../../Society/Factions%20During%20the%20Time%20of%20Doom.md#21-the-nevags), the [Speyvags](../../Society/Factions%20During%20the%20Time%20of%20Doom.md#22-the-speyvags) and the [Memivags](../../Society/Factions%20During%20the%20Time%20of%20Doom.md#23-the-memivags).
