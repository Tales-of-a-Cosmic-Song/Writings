# Natural Science of [Kisa](../Kivümi%20Language/Kivümi%20Dictionary/Kisa.md)

Kisa is mostly composed of the same ecosystems as what could be found on Earth, establishing and maintaining their balance is one of the primary tasks of the [kivüs](./Unique%20Species/kivü.md).  
The [yekis](./Unique%20Species/yeki.md) gave birth to the representants of all the species and replenish them whenever required, the wildlife is not allowed to evolve, biomes never changes, the ecosystem of the island is extremely static.

## 1. Ecosystems & Biomes

From the eastern coast to the center of Kisa lies a great mountain range, it is surrounded by temperate forests to the North and West, to the South are boreal forests. The forests themselves are surrounded by grand plains, more arid to the North, temperate to the West where they touch the coast, and toundra to the South.  
To the North West, between the coast and the plains is a great desert with a tropical forest at it's South Western edge.  
To the North East is a large tropical forest touching the coast.  
To the South West the boreal forest extends towards the coast and fills a large island there.  
South of the toundra is a frozen desert, touching the coast.

The eastern gulf only appeared after [Hepîpü Shômükmyo](../Characters/Hepîpü%20Shômükmyo.md) impaled himself and started the [Time of Doom](<../History of Kisa.md#3-time-of-doom>)
